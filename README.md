<h3>Differentiate between statically typed and dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category</h3>
<p>A statically typed language is one in which the data type of a value must be explicitly declared before it is used, and it cannot change during runtime. <br> Examples of statically typed programming languages include: Java, C++, C#, Swift, TypeScript</p>
<p>A dynamically typed language is one in which the data type of a value can be changed during runtime, and it is determined at runtime based on the value assigned to a variable. In a dynamically typed language like Python or JavaScript, you can assign different data types to a variable as needed, without having to explicitly declare its data type beforehand. <br>
Examples include; Python, JavaScript, PHP, Lua</p>

<h3>Differntiant between the Javascript data type 'null' and 'undefined&nbsp'</h3>
<p>undefined is used to indicate that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value, while null is used to explicitly represent a non-value.
